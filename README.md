Project Overview:

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict user behavior based on selected input features. It focuses on applying a supervised learning approach to solve a classification problem, including model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

Key Highlights:

->Performed data preprocessing including feature selection and train-test split

->Applied feature scaling to improve distance-based model performance

->Built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier

->Evaluated model performance using accuracy and prediction results

->Saved the trained model using Pickle for reuse

->Simple and interpretable machine learning classification approach

Technologies Used:

->Python

->Jupyter Notebook

->Pandas

->Matplotlib

->Scikit-learn

->Pickle

Conclusion:

The KNN classifier effectively predicts user purchase behavior based on demographic data. This project highlights the importance of feature scaling and provides a solid introduction to classification models, with scope for further enhancement using advanced algorithms or real-world data.
